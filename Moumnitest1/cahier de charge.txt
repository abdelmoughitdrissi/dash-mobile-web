Are you familiar with filter and reduce functions?

i dont want that all the dashbord show all the commands i want each dashbord show a region ?
yes i hear you but i

and each dashbord will show a city 

the dashbord of califoria will show just 

caus thers is 10 stores 

10 defferents places 

there is a droppdawn menu  

but if you see 

if just one dashbord receive lot of city the employee will be lost 
caus they will receive nother places orders ! code ok 


there are two compo.. 
one for the view  : invoices 

and one for all the orders yes 

YOU CAN CANTROLL THE MOUSE SIR :) ok 

data 

fire base



ok the problem that i found is the region is inside the view page not the orders 

ok 

th
an
k



const raw = {
  item1: { key: 'sdfd', value:'sdfd' },
  item2: { key: 'sdfd', value:'sdfd' },
  item3: { key: 'sdfd', value:'sdfd' }
};

const allowed = ['item1', 'item3'];

const filtered = Object.keys(raw)
  .filter(key => allowed.includes(key))
  .reduce((obj, key) => {
    obj[key] = raw[key];
    return obj;
  }, {});

console.log(filtered);

ok but okk its an array like json form yes ok

  }
